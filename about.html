            <p>
                V Sunny Creations was started in May of 2020, after I had just finished grad school and suddenly had a whole lot of time on my hands. Since I had to spend a lot of time at home because of the pandemic I began crafting to pass the time since I was tired of watching countless hours of TV. I had always loved painting and making things but stopped once I got busy with school. I am thakful for the free time I found to dive back in to activities I enjoy. It started as something I did to make gifts for my friends and family but has now grown into a small business. I am thankful for each and every one of the individuals who has placed an order or just given me a shoutout on instagram. I wish all of you health and happiness. -V
